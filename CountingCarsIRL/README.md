# Overview
After collecting all data from all groups we combined all the data on R. We ran the same shinyapp model as our previous analysis with our individual data. Using the self-analysis idea to see if we can come to any conclusions with the complete data.

# Analysis
The first thing I noticed was a slight decline in speed (mph) with an increase in temperature. I was under the impression that people tend to speed more when the temperature is higher but the plot graph actually showed a slight decline in speed as temperature increased. This may be due to a skew in the data as less data was collected on colder days, so more evenly distrubuted data may show another story.
