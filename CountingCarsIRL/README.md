# Overview
  After collecting all data from all groups we combined all the data on R. We ran the same shinyapp model as our previous analysis with our individual data. Using the self-analysis idea to see if we can come to any conclusions with the complete data.

# Analysis
  The first thing I noticed was a slight decline in speed (mph) with an increase in temperature. I was under the impression that people tend to speed more when the temperature is higher but the plot graph actually showed a slight decline in speed as temperature increases. This may be due to a skew in the data as less data was collected on colder days, so more evenly distributed data may show another story. This is the same story with Time and Speed. Not too much data was collected earlier in the day which can lead to an imbalance in the data.
  Another thing I noticed is that the highest speeds recorded has Illinois plates. There's two important factors to consider, the data was recorded in IL and only a couple groups collected plates. With these factors I still believe the data shows significance due to the multiple outliers with high speeds with Illinois plates. At this point I believe they aren't outliers and they assist the narrative that people from Illinois tend to speed more.

# Conclusion
  Originally I believed that with everyone's data combined we would be able to make assumptions which is the case but the correlations are small. I believe that more data that is evenly distributed would be able to provide us with more solid conclusions and correlations.
