# Final Project
## Authors: Gianni G., Sam M.
## Overview
  In this project we preformed analysis on country data provided to us via Kaggle. The two main tables include many variables with one containing data such as average IQ and literacy rate. The second contained random data from each country where we were able to run analysis to see if there was any correlation between the random data and IQ/Literacy rate.
